1. Opening the Program
- Clone the Team22 repository
- Open up Eclipse and make sure you are checked out into the master branch
- In Eclipse, make sure your Workspace is "Team22"
- In Eclipse, click "File" -> "New" -> "Java Project"
- Name the Java Project "iCare"
- Because the iCare folder already exists in Team22, your entire project should be instantiated
- In the Package Explorer of Eclipse, the Project Folder 'iCare" should show up, just in case, right click and refresh to make sure it has all the files
- Click the run button (green play button) on the upper tools bar
- A runnable GUI program should pop up

2. Logging In
- What should be shown is a Login Page. There should already be a default username and password (username is John, password is password)
- Click the "login" button, Login should be successful (in the event it isn't a Login Unsuccessful message should display)
- Afterwards, what should be shown is a User Homepage with a list of Actions they can do (some not implemented for now)

3.1 Logging Out
- Returns you back to the Login Page
3.2 View Tables
- Not covered in the sprint so leave out for now

3.3 Import Data
- Some prerequisites must be covered first

3.3.1 DB Browser for SQLite
- Install this software from https://sqlitebrowser.org/ and download the installer or code for whichever OS you are using
- This is a visual tool that enables you to view, create, design and edit database files compatibile with SQLite

3.3.2 Resources and Database
- Under the Team22 folder there is a folder called iCare. Enter this folder and there is a file called iCare.db, this is the database file
- Under the same iCare folder there is a folder called resources, in this folder exists 4 files, iCARE_template.xlsx, sample1.xls, sample1.xlsx, sample2.xlsx

3.3.3 Using DB Browser for SQLite
- First make sure the database file is a clean one. Open up DB Browser and click on Open Database
- Locate the database file specified above
- Here will be a database of all stored data, in the clean one there should only be one table of data, "Login" which is the table of all registered Users
- The only one in here should be the default username and password that we used to log in, a User of "John" and Password of "password"
- In the Browser Data tab, you can view the data for all Tables as an easy to access visual table

3.3.4 GUI of Import/Upload Data
- Back onto the program, there should be 3 buttons and a Drop-down menu
- Open: Allows you to select a file on your file system to upload to the database for storage
- Upload: Uploads data onto the database
- Main Menu: returns back to the User Homepage
- Drop-down menu: allows you to select what type of file to upload to the database (currently only supports .xls and .xlsx Excel files for the iCare template)

3.3.5 Using the Upload Data Page
- Make sure database is clean, if 3.3.3 wasn't followed
- In the Drop-down menu select "iCare Excel" (the only option), This will only make it so that we search for only Excel files
- Click "Open", a file explorer should pop up, search for your desired Excel file to upload. In this case navigate to the resources folder as specificied in 3.3.2
- Click on "Open", on success a Message Box will pop up saying "File is ready to be uploaded" with whichever given file you select
- Click on "Upload", on success a Message Box saying "Upload Success" will pop up, on failure "Error Uploading File, make sure File isn't corrupted
and/or mandatory fields are filled" will display.


3.3.6 Test Cases
- Follow the instructions in 3.3.5 and navigate to "iCARE_template.xlsx", the template given by the Client which has empty values, non-empty values, several rows and columns
	- Click on "iCARE_template.xlsx", File should be ready for upload
	- Click "Upload", this one may take a while as the template is a huge file with many rows and columns
	- You should recieve a popup stating that the import was unsuccessful, this is because mandatory fields within this template (marked by the orange text color) were missing values
	- This is not allowed, so import was stopped
	- Check this using DB Browser for SQLite, go to the Browse Data tab and click on the refresh button, there will be no iCare_template table, since the table was not fully imported, it was deleted when mandatory fields were found to be missing
- Follow the instructions in 3.3.5 and navigate to "sample1.xls", a test file with no missing data
	- Click on "sample1.xls", File should be ready for upload
	- Click "Upload", File should have been properly stored onto database
	- Check this using DB Browser for SQLite, now that data has been uploaded, go to the Browse Data tab and click on the refresh button
	- There should now be a table called "sample1" that can be selected in the Table Drop-down menu or visible in Database Structure tab
	- The data should match that of the original Excel file
- Follow the instructions in 3.3.5 and navigate to "sample1.xls" again
	- Click on "sample1.xls", File should be ready for upload
	- Click "Upload", File should have been properly stored onto database
	- Check this using DB Browser for SQLite, now that data has been uploaded, go to the Browse Data tab and click on the refresh button
	- There should now be a table called "sample1" and a table called "sample1_old" that can be selected in the Table Drop-down menu or visible in Database Structure tab
	- The "sample1_old" table should hold the same data as the "sample1" table, the _old tables are for saving the n-1 copy of templates uploaded
	- The data should match that of the original Excel file
- Follow the instructions in 3.3.5 and navigate to "sample1.xlsx", same contents as sample1.xls but using the newer .xlsx format for Excel
	- Click on "sample1.xlsx", File should be ready for upload
	- Click "Upload", File should have been properly stored onto database
	- Check this using DB Browser for SQLite, now that data has been uploaded, go to the Browse Data tab and click on the refresh button
	- There should now be a table called "sample1_old" that can be selected in the Table Drop-down menu or visible in Database Structure tab
	- This file, with the same name as "sample1.xls" will result in the following (like above case)
	- sample1 now is a table with the data from the latest upload, and sample1_old is the old table before the upload
- Follow the instructions in 3.3.5 and navigate to "sample2.xlsx", missing some values in some rows or coumns
	- Click on "sample2.xlsx", File should be ready for upload
	- Click "Upload", File should have been properly stored onto database
	- Check this using DB Browser for SQLite, now that data has been uploaded, go to the Browse Data tab and click on the refresh button
	- There should now be a table called "sample2" that can be selected in the Table Drop-down menu or visible in Database Structure tab
	- In the Browser Data tab in DB Browser, for the fields that were missing values (note they are not in mandatory fields), the value of "null" should have been inserted
